## 🕹 How to Use

    1. Clone the repository:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
        cd sorting-visualizer
        ```

    2. Open index.html in your browser.

    3. Choose an algorithm from the dropdown.

    4. Click Sort to see the animation.

    5. Use Reset to generate a new unsorted array.


🧠 Learning Goals
- Visualize how classic sorting algorithms operate

- Learn DOM manipulation using JavaScript

- Understand animation timing and UI feedback

- Practice clean code separation between logic and UI


💡 Future Enhancements
